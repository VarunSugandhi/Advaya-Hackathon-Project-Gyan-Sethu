## About the developer
I am currently a first-year student pursuing Computer Science and Design. As part of my learning journey, I have gained experience in frontend development and am actively working on enhancing my backend skills. This project is a great opportunity for me to understand how the different parts of a full-stack application come together.

I and my team participated in the Advaya Hackathon to gain hands-on experience and a better understanding of real-world application development, especially in building impactful solutions for rural education.

Note: The backend is not connected yet
